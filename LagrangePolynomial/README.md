# Lagrange: Lagrange interpolating polynomial

   yint = Lagrange(x,y,xx): Uses an (n − 1) −order
   
     Lagrange interpolating polynomial based on n data points to determine a value 
     of the dependent variable (yint) at a given value of the independent variable, xx.
     
 ## input:
 
*   x = independent variable
 *  y = dependent variable
  * xx = value of independent variable at which the
        interpolation is calculated
 ## output:
  
  * yint = interpolated value of dependent variable
