# Matrix LU Factorization and Partial Pivoting

This function takes the LU factorization of a square matrix 

to call this function it is [L U P]=luFactor(A)

# Inputs:
A = square matrix containing coefficents
# Outputs
* L = lower triangular matrix
* U = upper triangular matrix
* P = the permutation matrix
